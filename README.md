## About Me

Hybrid manager-designer-developers are rare. I'm a self-taught developer with a degree in architecture with a partial minor in graphic design. I spend my free time reading professional journals to keep up to date on industry trends, as well as learning new website technologies.

- ‚ù§Ô∏èüé® I love design and development.
- üèÑüå¥ I've travelled the world but California is the only place that feels like home.
- üìñüìö I value knowledge.
- üïπÔ∏èüéÆ Video games are my primary recreation.
- ü•è‚õ≥ Sports aren't my thing but I do play frisbee golf and volleyball.
- üå≤üêà Plants and animals make me happy.
- üíªüñ±Ô∏è I'm platform agnostic. Arch, Debian, Mac, Windows, Chrome, Android, iOS, AR, VR, wearables, voice assistants, AI, whatever.
- ‚å®Ô∏è‚å®Ô∏è [I build custom keyboards](https://www.instagram.com/keebl.me/).

### Myers-Briggs Personality type:

## How I think

- I operate in a no-judgement zone.
- The phrase "intent vs impact" is of high importance to me.
- I want everyone to succeed. Please let me know if you feel you have been set up for failure.
- I want you to feel comfortable around me. Please let me know if there is any way I can improve.
- I prefer the frank and direct approach and won't take it personally.
- I understand and empathize that others might not like the direct approach.
- I value self-sufficiency.
- I prefer long term thinking over short term thinking.
- I'm a fan of [the K.I.S.S principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).
- I honor the 5 Ws. Who, what, when, where, and why? I love it when you ask those questions too.
- Let's document things! Documentation benefits everyone.
- My background in architecture adds a unique behavioral psychology element to my designs.

## Working with me

I'm in the Pacific time zone. That said, I'm flexible to be accommodate your schedule. We're all in this together!

## How I learn

Everyone has a different learning style. I learn best by reading, doing, or actively conversing. I don't learn as well from audio-visual sources and I find videos to be distracting.
